# Use an API with React

## Question 1

Call the JSON Placeholder API `/users`. The endpoint is this: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`. Then display a list of all of the people's usernames. You don't need to make it look nice at all.

## Question 2

_Run `npm test` in the terminal and you can see the tests no longer pass_

Make the tests pass. You must have at least 1 test
Add `data-testid="TestDataID"` to an element to make it identifiable and get it using `screen.getByTestId("TestDataID");`
