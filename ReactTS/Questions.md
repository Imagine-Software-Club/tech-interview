# React Counter using Typescript

## Question 1

In `App.tsx` repurpose the example app to be a counter. Make a spot where you can see what the current count is and then a button which increments the count by 1

## next question

in `Next/testing`, create a link to the `dashboard` page, then create a counter that increments on each click & display the total count
