# React Counter using Typescript
Things in italics are not to be read to the candidate and are instead for the interviewer to prepare the question

## Question 1
In `App.tsx` repurpose the example app to be a counter. Make a spot where you can see what the current count is and then a button which increments the count by 1

__Run `npm test` in the terminal and show the interviewer that the tests no longer pass__
## Question 2
Make the tests pass. You must have at least 1 test
Add `data-testid="TestDataID"` to an element to make it identifiable and get it using `screen.getByTestId("TestDataID");`
